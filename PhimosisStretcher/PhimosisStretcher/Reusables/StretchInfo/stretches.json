        "closingText": "You can use any two fingers for this exercise, however, as you progress you should begin to use larger fingers as the foreskin gets wider. \n \nThis exercise is the most important exercise in the stretching process as it begins to widen the phimotic band enabling the foreskin to begin retracting over the head of the penis. \n \nThis method is safe because you will be able to feel the limits you can stretch your phimotic band without causing tears."
