        <h3>Log Data</h3>
    
        <p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
    
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
            <br><br>
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app uses third party code and libraries provided by Google that use “cookies” to collect information, tailor adverts to display to you and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you should uninstall the free mobile product and/or choose an available paid version of mobile products, which does not collect cookies.

        <h3>Advertisments</h3>
    
        <p>
            To be able to offer you our services for free, we show third party ads within your mobile apps through popular ad networks, which are listed below. You can tap the icon to learn more about the ad network.
            <br><br>
            To enable the ad, we embed a third-party software development kit (SDK) for these ads. The SDK code is provided by third party ad agencies or networks.
            <br><br>
            Data of our mobile users remain anonymous to us and to the third party ad agencies. However, the ad agencies’ SDK code will collect data to tailor ads to you, such as the third-party apps you installed on your device, your iOS advertising identifier, your IP Address, your device's operating system details and MAC address, and other statistical and technical information. You can find more information in each network’s privacy policy, the link to which we are also including in the overview below.
